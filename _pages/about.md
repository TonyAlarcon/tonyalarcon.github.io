I am a <span class="about-highlight">Ph.D. candidate in Computer Science and Engineering</span> at the University of Notre Dame, where I develop AI-enabled autonomy for UAV systems operating in complex and safety-critical environments. I earned my <span class="about-highlight">M.S. in Computer Science and Engineering</span> from Notre Dame and previously completed a <span class="about-highlight">B.S. in Astrophysics</span> at UCLA.

My research focuses on reinforcement learning, large language models, coverage path planning, and uncertainty-aware decision-making for autonomous aerial systems. I am particularly interested in building autonomy stacks that are not only intelligent, but trustworthy and deployable in real-world missions.

My work has been published across leading venues in robotics, AI, and cyber-physical systems, including ICRA, *Machine Learning with Applications* (MLWA), CAIN, IEEE RE, ENVIRE, and AIAA Aviation. These contributions span safe separation requirements, UAV health analytics, digital twins, and multi-agent reinforcement learning.

My work and teaching have been recognized through distinctions, honors, and awards, including the Kaneb Outstanding Graduate Teaching Assistant Award at Notre Dame, Best Data Science Project Presentation, and academic honors at Santa Monica College and UCLA.
